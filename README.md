## Project contains 2 text file and 2 .py files.
### Text File
  * AOI.txt
  * LesMiserablesbyVictorHugo.txt
### .Py
  * WordStuff.py
  * WordStuffWithMPI.py

### To use the .py files:
#### __For WordStuff.py__ all you really to do is change the title variable in line 56. This includes any directory info if the text is not in the same directory as this .py file.
#### __For WordStuffWithMPI.py__ you need to have mpi4py installed. You can use google collab to install it and run it with:
## !mpirun --allow-run-as-root -np n  python gather.py 
#### where n is the number of workers.
